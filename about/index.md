I have been a web developer (frontend and backend) since 2007. Starting in 2011, my focus shifted to mobile(iOS) development. In my 7 years as developer, I worked with both public institution (i.e. Federal Police of Brazil) and private IT firms on software development (web and mobile). 

Besides that, I'm one of the founders of [iOSDevBR](http://www.facebook.com/groups/iosdevbr), a study group for iOS knowledge sharing in Brazil. 

I'm BS in Computer Science by [Catholic University of Pernambuco - Brazil](http://www.unicap.br). Nowadays, I work with activities related to mobile software development and I'm a Senior iOS Engineer in [Avenue Code](http://avenuecode.com).
