Here I'll post a list of books that I mark as important to me. 
Any read material that atracts me: Articles/Books of tech, science, astronomy, biology, math, arts, social, history, philosofy...

I'll do my best to categorize that in the best way....but sometimes...you know....will only make sense in my head. Sorry! ;)
